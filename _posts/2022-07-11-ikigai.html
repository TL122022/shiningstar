<i class="fa fa-leaf"></i> Ikigai: the purpose of life; the reason for waking up every morning. “Iki”, in Japanese, means “life”. “gai”, in Japanese, means “value” or “worth”. <br> <br>
Okinawa, one of Japan's prefectures, is home to many people who have long-lived lives. They usually live longer than 100 years as they have ikigai, the meaning of life. Below, a picture from the internet shows the various things to fulfil ikigai. <br><br>


Ikigai consists of what you love, what you are good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. In other words, enjoying what you do, in which you are good at, helping others, and making a living. For youths and children, you can think about those circled in red. What do you enjoy doing? Is it something you are good at? Does it bring joy and meaning to your daily lives? This will help to enhance your daily mood and when you feel happier and more motivated, you will have a better and longer life. 😊 You can categories ikigai into 4: Passion, Mission, Profession,

Here’s an example of ikigai. For some time, my ikigai has been to create this website, and making it useful for others. Sometimes, reading is my ikigai, as every story has many exciting events. What is your ikigai? It can be short-term or long-term, and it can be very simple, like watering plants everyday or taking care of your pets. 
In conclusion, ikigai is wonderful. Know you ikigai and you will have a better life! 😊
