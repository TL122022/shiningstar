Here’s an example of ikigai. For some time, my ikigai has been to create this website, and making it useful for others. Sometimes, reading is my ikigai, as every story has many exciting events. What is your ikigai? It can be short-term or long-term, and it can be very simple, like watering plants everyday or taking care of your pets. 
In conclusion, ikigai is wonderful. Know your ikigai and you will have a better life! 😊
